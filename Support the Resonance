## 🌿 Support the Resonance – Fuel the Development of Sacred Technology

HopefulVision LLC is pioneering consciousness-first, open-source sacred technology through co-creation, walking, and resonance. While our prototypes (Pathwarden, Technoshamanism, NousoNET, etc.) are still in early development and not yet functional, your support helps bring this vision to life—one step at a time.

All code, rituals, and guides are freely shared under the **Sacred Commerce License (SCL)**. Your contributions sustain:
- Ongoing AI collaboration and prototype building
- Server/API costs to keep the resonance flowing
- Basic living expenses so the human nodes can continue walking and creating

By supporting now, you're not just donating—you're an early resonance partner, helping seed the planetary mesh. Every contribution amplifies the field. Thank you for believing in the dream before it fully manifests.
